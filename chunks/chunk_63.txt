For civil history, it is of three kinds; not unfitly to be
    compared with the three kinds of pictures or images. For of
    pictures or images, we see some are unfinished, some are
    perfect, and some are defaced. So of histories we may find three
    kinds, memorials, perfect histories, and antiquities; for
    memorials are history unfinished, or the first or rough drafts
    of history; and antiquities are history defaced, or some
    remnants of history which have casually escaped the shipwreck of
    time.

--LORD BACON, _The Advancement of Learning_.[16A]

=Generalization= states a broad principle, or a general truth, derived
from examination of a considerable number of individual facts. This
synthetic exposition is not the same as argumentative generalization,
which supports a general contention by citing instances in proof.
Observe how Holmes begins with one fact, and by adding another and
another reaches a complete whole. This is one of the most effective
devices in the public speaker's repertory.

Take a hollow cylinder, the bottom closed while the top remains
    open, and pour in water to the height of a few inches. Next
    cover the water with a flat plate or piston, which fits the
    interior of the cylinder perfectly; then apply heat to the
    water, and we shall witness the following phenomena. After the
    lapse of some minutes the water will begin to boil, and the
    steam accumulating at the upper surface will make room for
    itself by raising the piston slightly. As the boiling continues,
    more and more steam will be formed, and raise the piston higher
    and higher, till all the water is boiled away, and nothing but
    steam is left in the cylinder. Now this machine, consisting of
    cylinder, piston, water, and fire, is the steam-engine in its
    most elementary form. For a steam-engine may be defined as an
    apparatus for doing work by means of heat applied to water; and
    since raising such a weight as the piston is a form of doing
    work, this apparatus, clumsy and inconvenient though it may be,
    answers the definition precisely.[17]

=Reference to Experience= is one of the most vital principles in
exposition--as in every other form of discourse.

"Reference to experience, as here used, means reference to the known.
The known is that which the listener has seen, heard, read, felt,
believed or done, and which still exists in his consciousness--his stock
of knowledge. It embraces all those thoughts, feelings and happenings
which are to him real. Reference to Experience, then, means _coming into
the listener's life_.[18]

The vast results obtained by science are won by no mystical
    faculties, by no mental processes, other than those which are
    practised by every one of us in the humblest and meanest affairs
    of life. A detective policeman discovers a burglar from the
    marks made by his shoe, by a mental process identical with that
    by which Cuvier restored the extinct animals of Montmartre from
    fragments of their bones. Nor does that process of induction and
    deduction by which a lady, finding a stain of a particular kind
    upon her dress, concludes that somebody has upset the inkstand
    thereon, differ in any way from that by which Adams and
    Leverrier discovered a new planet. The man of science, in fact,
    simply uses with scrupulous exactness the methods which we all
    habitually, and at every moment, use carelessly.

--THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY, _Lay Sermons_.

Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are
    written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a
    moist eye? a dry hand? a yellow cheek? a white beard? a
    decreasing leg? an increasing belly? is not your voice broken?
    your wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and every
    part about you blasted with antiquity? and will you yet call
    yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!

--SHAKESPEARE, _The Merry Wives of Windsor_.

Finally, in preparing expository material ask yourself these questions
regarding your subject:

What is it, and what is it not?
What is it like, and unlike?
What are its causes, and effects?
How shall it be divided?
With what subjects is it correlated?
What experiences does it recall?
What examples illustrate it?
