_Ant._ If you have tears, prepare to shed them now;
    You all do know this mantle: I remember
    The first time ever Caesar put it on;
    'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
    That day he overcame the Nervii.
    Look, in this place, ran Cassius' dagger through:
    See, what a rent the envious Casca made:
    Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stab'd;
    And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
    Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it!--
    As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd
    If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
    For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
    Judge, O you Gods, how Caesar lov'd him!
    This was the most unkindest cut of all!
    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
    Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
    And in his mantle muffling up his face,
    Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
    Oh what a fall was there, my countrymen!
    Then I and you, and all of us, fell down,
    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
    Oh! now you weep; and I perceive you feel
    The dint of pity; these are gracious drops.
    Kind souls! what, weep you, when you but behold
    Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here!
    Here is himself, mar'd, as you see, by traitors.

_1 Ple._ Oh, piteous spectacle!

_2 Ple._ Oh, noble Caesar!

_3 Ple._ Oh, woful day!

_4 Ple._ Oh, traitors, villains!

_1 Ple._ Oh, most bloody sight!

_2 Ple._ We will be reveng'd!

_All._ Revenge; about--seek--burn--fire--kill--day!--Let not
    a traitor live!

_Ant._ Stay, countrymen.

_1 Ple._ Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.

_2 Ple._ We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.

_Ant._ Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
    To such a sudden flood of mutiny:
    They that have done this deed are honorable:
    What private griefs they have, alas! I know not,
    That made them do it; they are wise, and honorable,
    And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts;
    I am no orator, as Brutus is;
    But as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
    That love my friend, and that they know full well
    That gave me public leave to speak of him:
    For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
    Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
    To stir men's blood. I only speak right on:
    I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
    Show your sweet Caesar's wounds, poor, poor, dumb mouths,
    And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,
    And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
    Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
    In every wound of Caesar, that should move
    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

_All._ We'll mutiny!

_1 Ple._ We'll burn the house of Brutus.

_3 Ple._ Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.

_Ant._ Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.

_All._ Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony.

_Ant._ Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
    Wherein hath Caesar thus deserv'd your loves?
    Alas! you know not!--I must tell you then.
    You have forgot the will I told you of.

_Ple._ Most true;--the will!--let's stay, and hear the will.

_Ant._ Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
    To every Roman citizen he gives,
    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.

_2 Ple._ Most noble Caesar!--we'll revenge his death.

_3 Ple._ O royal Caesar!

_Ant._ Hear me with patience.

_All._ Peace, ho!

_Ant._ Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
    His private arbours, and new-planted orchards,
    On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
    And to your heirs forever, common pleasures,
    To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
    Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?

_1 Ple._ Never, never!--Come, away, away!
    We'll burn his body in the holy place,
    And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
    Take up the body.

_2 Ple._ Go, fetch fire.

_3 Ple._ Pluck down benches.

_4 Ple._ Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
                                      [_Exeunt Citizens, with the body._

_Ant._ Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
    Take thou what course thou wilt!

To unify single, auditors into a crowd, express their common needs,
aspirations, dangers, and emotions, deliver your message so that the
interests of one shall appear to be the interests of all. The conviction
of one man is intensified in proportion as he finds others sharing his
belief--_and feeling_. Antony does not stop with telling the Roman
populace that Caesar fell--he makes the tragedy universal:

Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
    Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.

Applause, generally a sign of feeling, helps to unify an audience. The
nature of the crowd is illustrated by the contagion of applause.
Recently a throng in a New York moving-picture and vaudeville house had
been applauding several songs, and when an advertisement for tailored
skirts was thrown on the screen some one started the applause, and the
crowd, like sheep, blindly imitated--until someone saw the joke and
laughed; then the crowd again followed a leader and laughed at and
applauded its own stupidity.

Actors sometimes start applause for their lines by snapping their
fingers. Some one in the first few rows will mistake it for faint
applause, and the whole theatre will chime in.
