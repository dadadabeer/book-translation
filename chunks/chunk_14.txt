See him there, cold and gray,
    Watch him as he tries to play;
    No, he doesn't know the way--
    He began to learn too late.
    She's a grim old hag, is Fate,
    For she let him have his pile,
    Smiling to herself the while,
    Knowing what the cost would be,
    When he'd found the Golden Key.
    Multimillionaire is he,
    Many times more rich than we;
    But at that I wouldn't trade
    With the bargain that he made.
    Came here many years ago,
    Not a person did he know;
    Had the money-hunger bad--
    Mad for money, piggish mad;
    Didn't let a joy divert him,
    Didn't let a sorrow hurt him,
    Let his friends and kin desert him,
    While he planned and plugged and hurried
    On his quest for gold and power.
    Every single wakeful hour
    With a money thought he'd dower;
    All the while as he grew older,
    And grew bolder, he grew colder.
    And he thought that some day
    He would take the time to play;
    But, say--he was wrong.
    Life's a song;
    In the spring
    Youth can sing and can fling;
    But joys wing
    When we're older,
    Like birds when it's colder.
    The roses were red as he went rushing by,
    And glorious tapestries hung in the sky,
    And the clover was waving
    'Neath honey-bees' slaving;
    A bird over there
    Roundelayed a soft air;
    But the man couldn't spare
    Time for gathering flowers,
    Or resting in bowers,
    Or gazing at skies
    That gladdened the eyes.
    So he kept on and swept on
    Through mean, sordid years.
    Now he's up to his ears
    In the choicest of stocks.
    He owns endless blocks
    Of houses and shops,
    And the stream never stops
    Pouring into his banks.
    I suppose that he ranks
    Pretty near to the top.
    What I have wouldn't sop
    His ambition one tittle;
    And yet with my little
    I don't care to trade
    With the bargain he made.
    Just watch him to-day--
    See him trying to play.
    He's come back for blue skies.
    But they're in a new guise--
    Winter's here, all is gray,
    The birds are away,
    The meadows are brown,
    The leaves lie aground,
    And the gay brook that wound
    With a swirling and whirling
    Of waters, is furling
    Its bosom in ice.
    And he hasn't the price,
    With all of his gold,
    To buy what he sold.
    He knows now the cost
    Of the spring-time he lost,
    Of the flowers he tossed
    From his way,
    And, say,
    He'd pay
    Any price if the day
    Could be made not so gray.
    _He can't play._

_Change of Tempo Prevents Monotony_

The canary in the cage before the window is adding to the beauty and
charm of his singing by a continual change of tempo. If King Solomon had
been an orator he undoubtedly would have gathered wisdom from the song
of the wild birds as well as from the bees. Imagine a song written with
but quarter notes. Imagine an auto with only one speed.

1. Note the change of tempo indicated in the following, and how it gives
a pleasing variety. Read it aloud. (Fast tempo is indicated by italics,
slow by small capitals.)

_And he thought that some day he would take the time to play;
    but, say_--HE WAS WRONG. LIFE'S A SONG; _in the_ SPRING YOUTH
    _can_ SING _and can_ FLING; BUT JOYS WING WHEN WE'RE OLDER, LIKE
    THE BIRDS _when it's_ COLDER. _The roses were red as he went
    rushing by, and glorious tapestries hung in the sky._

2. Turn to "Fools Gold," on Page 42, and deliver it in an unvaried
tempo: note how monotonous is the result. This poem requires a great
many changes of tempo, and is an excellent one for practise.

3. Use the changes of tempo indicated in the following, noting how they
prevent monotony. Where no change of tempo is indicated, use a moderate
speed. Too much of variety would really be a return to monotony.

"A MOB KILLS THE WRONG MAN" _was flashed in a newspaper headline
    lately. The mob is an_ IRRESPONSIBLE, UNTHINKING MASS. _It
    always destroys_ BUT NEVER CONSTRUCTS. _It criticises_ BUT NEVER
    CREATES.

_Utter a great truth_ AND THE MOB WILL HATE YOU. _See how it
    condemned_ DANTE _to_ EXILE. _Encounter the dangers of the
    unknown world for its benefit_, AND THE MOB WILL DECLARE YOU
    CRAZY. _It ridiculed_ COLUMBUS, _and for discovering a new
    world_ GAVE HIM PRISON AND CHAINS.

_Write a poem to thrill human hearts with pleasure_, AND THE MOB
    WILL ALLOW YOU TO GO HUNGRY: THE BLIND HOMER BEGGED BREAD
    THROUGH THE STREETS. _Invent a machine to save labor_ AND THE
    MOB WILL DECLARE YOU ITS ENEMY. _Less than a hundred years ago a
    furious rabble smashed Thimonier's invention, the sewing
    machine._

BUILD A STEAMSHIP TO CARRY MERCHANDISE AND ACCELERATE TRAVEL
    _and the mob will call you a fool_. A MOB LINED THE SHORES OF
    THE HUDSON RIVER TO LAUGH AT THE MAIDEN ATTEMPT OF "FULTON'S
    FOLLY," _as they called his little steamboat._

Emerson says: "A mob is a society of bodies voluntarily
    bereaving themselves of reason and traversing its work. The mob
    is man voluntarily descended to the nature of the beast. _Its
    fit hour of activity_ is NIGHT. ITS ACTIONS ARE INSANE, _like
    its whole constitution. It persecutes a principle_--IT WOULD
    WHIP A RIGHT. It would tar and feather justice by inflicting
    fire and outrage upon the house and persons of those who have
    these."

The mob spirit stalks abroad in our land today. Every week gives
    a fresh victim to its malignant cry for blood. There were 48
    persons killed by mobs in the United States in 1913; 64 in 1912,
    and 71 in 1911. Among the 48 last year were a woman and a child.
    Two victims were proven innocent after their death.
