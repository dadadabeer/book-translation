Note how Antony played upon the feelings of his hearers in the famous
funeral oration given by Shakespeare in "Julius Caesar." From murmuring
units the men became a unit--a mob.

_ANTONY'S ORATION OVER CAESAR'S BODY_
    Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears;
    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
    The evil that men do lives after them;
    The good is oft interred with their bones:
    So let it be with Caesar! The Noble Brutus
    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.
    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
    And grievously hath Caesar answered it.
    Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest--
    For Brutus is an honorable man,
    So are they all, all honorable men--
    Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
    He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
    But Brutus says he was ambitious;
    And Brutus is an honorable man.
    He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
    Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
    When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;
    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
    Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious;
    And Brutus is an honorable man.
    You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
    Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
    And sure, he is an honorable man.
    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
    But here I am to speak what I do know.
    You all did love him once, not without cause;
    What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
    Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
    And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
    And I must pause till it come back to me. [_Weeps._

_1 Plebeian._ Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.

_2 Ple._ If thou consider rightly of the matter,
    Caesar has had great wrong.

_3 Ple._ Has he, masters?
    I fear there will a worse come in his place.

_4 Ple._ Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
    Therefore, 'tis certain, he was not ambitious.

_1 Ple._ If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

_2 Ple._ Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.

_3 Ple._ There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

_4 Ple._ Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

_Ant._ But yesterday, the word of Caesar might
    Have stood against the world: now lies he there,
    And none so poor to do him reverence.
    Oh, masters! if I were dispos'd to stir
    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
    I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
    Who, you all know, are honorable men.
    I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
    To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,
    Than I will wrong such honorable men.
    But here's a parchment, with the seal of Caesar;
    I found it in his closet; 'tis his will:
    Let but the commons hear this testament--
    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
    And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds,
    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;
    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
    And, dying, mention it within their wills,
    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
    Unto their issue.

_4 Ple._ We'll hear the will: Read it, Mark Antony.

_All._ The will! the will! we will hear Caesar's will.

_Ant._ Have patience, gentle friends: I must not read it;
    It is not meet you know how Caesar lov'd you.
    You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
    And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
    It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
    'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
    For if you should, oh, what would come of it!

_4 Ple._ Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony!
    You shall read us the will! Caesar's will!

_Ant._ Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
    I have o'ershot myself, to tell you of it.
    I fear I wrong the honorable men
    Whose daggers have stab'd Caesar; I do fear it.

_4 Ple._ They were traitors: Honorable men!

_All._ The will! the testament!

_2 Ple._ They were villains, murtherers! The will! Read the will!

_Ant._ You will compel me then to read the will?
    Then, make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
    And let me shew you him that made the will.
    Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?

_All._ Come down.

_2 Ple._ Descend. [_He comes down from the Rostrum_.

_3 Ple._ You shall have leave.

_4 Ple._ A ring; stand round.

_1 Ple._ Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.

_2 Ple._ Room for Antony!--most noble Antony!

_Ant._ Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.

_All._ Stand back! room! bear back!
