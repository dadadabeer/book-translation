There, by night _the cotton whitens beneath the stars,_ and by
    day _THE WHEAT LOCKS THE SUNSHINE IN ITS BEARDED SHEAF._ In the
    same field the clover steals the fragrance of the wind, and
    tobacco catches the quick aroma of the rains. _THERE ARE
    MOUNTAINS STORED WITH EXHAUSTLESS TREASURES: forests--vast and
    primeval;_ and rivers that, _tumbling or loitering, run wanton to
    the sea._ Of the three essential items of all industries--cotton,
    iron and wood--that region has easy control. _IN COTTON, a fixed
    monopoly--IN IRON, proven supremacy--IN TIMBER, the
    reserve supply of the Republic._ From this assured and
    permanent advantage, against which artificial conditions cannot
    much longer prevail, has grown an amazing system of industries.
    Not maintained by human contrivance of tariff or capital, afar
    off from the fullest and cheapest source of supply, but resting
    in divine assurance, within touch of field and mine and forest--not
    set amid costly farms from which competition has driven the
    farmer in despair, but amid cheap and sunny lands, rich with
    agriculture, to which neither season nor soil has set a limit--this
    system of industries is mounting to a splendor that shall dazzle
    and illumine the world. _THAT, SIR, is the picture and the promise
    of my home--A LAND BETTER AND FAIRER THAN I HAVE TOLD YOU, and
    yet but fit setting in its material excellence for the loyal and
    gentle quality of its citizenship._

This hour little needs the _LOYALTY THAT IS LOYAL TO ONE SECTION
    and yet holds the other in enduring suspicion and estrangement._
    Give us the _broad_ and _perfect loyalty that loves and trusts
    GEORGIA_ alike with _Massachusetts_--that knows no _SOUTH_, no
    _North_, no _EAST_, no _West_, but _endears with equal and
    patriotic love_ every foot of our soil, every State of our
    Union.

_A MIGHTY DUTY, SIR, AND A MIGHTY INSPIRATION impels every one
    of us to-night to lose in patriotic consecration WHATEVER
    ESTRANGES, WHATEVER DIVIDES._

_WE, SIR, are Americans--AND WE STAND FOR HUMAN LIBERTY!_ The
    uplifting force of the American idea is under every throne on
    earth. _France, Brazil--THESE ARE OUR VICTORIES. To redeem the
    earth from kingcraft and oppression--THIS IS OUR MISSION! AND WE
    SHALL NOT FAIL._ God has sown in our soil the seed of His
    millennial harvest, and He will not lay the sickle to the
    ripening crop until His full and perfect day has come. _OUR
    HISTORY, SIR, has been a constant and expanding miracle, FROM
    PLYMOUTH ROCK AND JAMESTOWN,_ all the way--aye, even from the
    hour when from the voiceless and traceless ocean a new world
    rose to the sight of the inspired sailor. As we approach the
    fourth centennial of that stupendous day--when the old world
    will come to _marvel_ and to _learn_ amid our gathered
    treasures--let us resolve to crown the miracles of our past with
    the spectacle of a Republic, _compact, united INDISSOLUBLE IN
    THE BONDS OF LOVE_--loving from the Lakes to the Gulf--the
    wounds of war healed in every heart as on every hill, _serene
    and resplendent AT THE SUMMIT OF HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT AND EARTHLY
    GLORY, blazing out the path and making clear the way up which
    all the nations of the earth, must come in God's appointed
    time!_

--HENRY W. GRADY, _The Race Problem_.

_ ... I WOULD CALL HIM NAPOLEON_, but Napoleon made his way to
    empire _over broken oaths and through a sea of blood._ This man
    never broke his word. "No Retaliation" was his great motto and
    the rule of his life; _AND THE LAST WORDS UTTERED TO HIS SON IN
    FRANCE WERE THESE: "My boy, you will one day go back to Santo
    Domingo; forget that France murdered your father." I WOULD CALL
    HIM CROMWELL,_ but Cromwell _was only a soldier, and the state
    he founded went down with him into his grave. I WOULD CALL HIM
    WASHINGTON,_ but the great Virginian _held slaves. THIS MAN
    RISKED HIS EMPIRE rather than permit the slave-trade in the
    humblest village of his dominions._

_YOU THINK ME A FANATIC TO-NIGHT,_ for you read history, _not
    with your eyes, BUT WITH YOUR PREJUDICES._ But fifty years
    hence, when Truth gets a hearing, the Muse of History will put
    _PHOCION for the Greek,_ and _BRUTUS for the Roman, HAMPDEN for
    England, LAFAYETTE for France,_ choose _WASHINGTON as the
    bright, consummate flower of our EARLIER civilization, AND JOHN
    BROWN the ripe fruit of our NOONDAY,_ then, dipping her pen in
    the sunlight, will write in the clear blue, above them all, the
    name of _THE SOLDIER, THE STATESMAN, THE MARTYR, TOUSSAINT
    L'OUVERTURE._

--Wendell Phillips, _Toussaint l'Ouverture_.

EFFICIENCY THROUGH CHANGE OF PACE

Hear how he clears the points o' Faith
    Wi' rattlin' an' thumpin'!
    Now meekly calm, now wild in wrath,
    He's stampin' an' he's jumpin'.

--ROBERT BURNS, _Holy Fair_.

The Latins have bequeathed to us a word that has no precise equivalent
in our tongue, therefore we have accepted it, body unchanged--it is the
word _tempo_, and means _rate of movement_, as measured by the time
consumed in executing that movement.
