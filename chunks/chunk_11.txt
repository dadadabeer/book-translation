Note: In the following selections, those passages that may best be
delivered in a moderate pitch are printed in ordinary (roman) type.
Those which may be rendered in a high pitch--do not make the mistake of
raising the voice too high--are printed _in italics_. Those which might
well be spoken in a low pitch are printed in _CAPITALS_.

These arrangements, however, are merely suggestive--we cannot make it
strong enough that you must use your own judgment in interpreting a
selection. Before doing so, however, it is well to practise these
passages as they are marked.

_Yes, all men labor. RUFUS CHOATE AND DANIEL WEBSTER_ labor, say
    the critics. But every man who reads of the labor question knows
    that it means the movement of the men that earn their living
    with their hands; _THAT ARE EMPLOYED, AND PAID WAGES: are
    gathered under roofs of factories, sent out on farms, sent out
    on ships, gathered on the walls._ In popular acceptation, the
    working class means the men that work with their hands, for
    wages, so many hours a day, employed by great capitalists; that
    work for everybody else. Why do we move for this class? "_Why_,"
    asks a critic, "_don't you move FOR ALL WORKINGMEN?" BECAUSE,
    WHILE DANIEL WEBSTER GETS FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ARGUING THE
    MEXICAN CLAIMS, there is no need of anybody's moving for him.
    BECAUSE, WHILE RUFUS CHOATE GETS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR
    MAKING ONE ARGUMENT TO A JURY, there is no need of moving for
    him, or for the men that work with their brains_,--that do
    highly disciplined and skilled labor, invent, and write books.
    The reason why the Labor movement confines itself to a single
    class is because that class of work _DOES NOT GET PAID, does not
    get protection. MENTAL LABOR is adequately paid_, and _MORE THAN
    ADEQUATELY protected. IT CAN SHIFT ITS CHANNELS; it can vary
    according to the supply and demand_.

_IF A MAN FAILS AS A MINISTER, why, he becomes a railway
    conductor. IF THAT DOESN'T SUIT HIM, he goes West, and becomes
    governor of a territory. AND IF HE FINDS HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF
    EITHER OF THESE POSITIONS, he comes home, and gets to be a city
    editor_. He varies his occupation as he pleases, and doesn't
    need protection. _BUT THE GREAT MASS, CHAINED TO A TRADE, DOOMED
    TO BE GROUND UP IN THE MILL OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND, THAT WORK SO
    MANY HOURS A DAY, AND MUST RUN IN THE GREAT RUTS OF
    BUSINESS,--they are the men whose inadequate protection, whose
    unfair share of the general product, claims a movement in their
    behalf_.

--WENDELL PHILLIPS.

_KNOWING THE PRICE WE MUST PAY, THE SACRIFICE WE MUST MAKE, THE
    BURDENS WE MUST CARRY, THE ASSAULTS WE MUST ENDURE--KNOWING FULL
    WELL THE COST--yet we enlist, and we enlist for the war. FOR WE
    KNOW THE JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE, and we know, too, its certain
    triumph.

NOT RELUCTANTLY THEN, but eagerly_, not with _faint hearts BUT
    STRONG, do we now advance upon the enemies of the people. FOR
    THE CALL THAT COMES TO US is the call that came to our fathers_.
    As they responded so shall we.

"_HE HATH SOUNDED FORTH A TRUMPET that shall never call retreat.
    HE IS SIFTING OUT THE HEARTS OF MEN before His judgment seat.
    OH, BE SWIFT OUR SOULS TO ANSWER HIM, BE JUBILANT OUR FEET,
        Our God is marching on_."

--ALBERT J. BEVERIDGE.

Remember that two sentences, or two parts of the same sentence, which
contain changes of thought, cannot possibly be given effectively in the
same key. Let us repeat, every big change of thought requires a big
change of pitch. What the beginning student will think are big changes
of pitch will be monotonously alike. Learn to speak some thoughts in a
very high tone--others in a _very_, _very_ low tone. _DEVELOP RANGE._ It
is almost impossible to use too much of it.

_HAPPY AM I THAT THIS MISSION HAS BROUGHT MY FEET AT LAST TO
    PRESS NEW ENGLAND'S HISTORIC SOIL and my eyes to the knowledge
    of her beauty and her thrift._ Here within touch of Plymouth
    Rock and Bunker Hill--_WHERE WEBSTER THUNDERED and Longfellow
    sang, Emerson thought AND CHANNING PREACHED--HERE IN THE CRADLE
    OF AMERICAN LETTERS and almost of American liberty,_ I hasten to
    make the obeisance that every American owes New England when
    first he stands uncovered in her mighty presence. _Strange
    apparition!_ This stern and unique figure--carved from the ocean
    and the wilderness--its majesty kindling and growing amid the
    storms of winter and of wars--until at last the gloom was
    broken, _ITS BEAUTY DISCLOSED IN THE SUNSHINE, and the heroic
    workers rested at its base_--while startled kings and emperors
    gazed and marveled that from the rude touch of this handful cast
    on a bleak and unknown shore should have come the _embodied
    genius of human government AND THE PERFECTED MODEL OF HUMAN
    LIBERTY!_ God bless the memory of those immortal workers, and
    prosper the fortunes of their living sons--and perpetuate the
    inspiration of their handiwork....

Far to the South, Mr. President, separated from this section by
    a line--_once defined in irrepressible difference, once traced
    in fratricidal blood, AND NOW, THANK GOD, BUT A VANISHING
    SHADOW--lies the fairest and richest domain of this earth. It is
    the home of a brave and hospitable people. THERE IS CENTERED ALL
    THAT CAN PLEASE OR PROSPER HUMANKIND. A PERFECT CLIMATE ABOVE a
    fertile soil_ yields to the husbandman every product of the
    temperate zone.
